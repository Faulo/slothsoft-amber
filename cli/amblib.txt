         AMBERWORLD - THE AMBERMOON OPEN SOURCE PROJECT

================================================================
          AmberMap v0.6 (2004-04-01) by Oliver Gantert
----------------------------------------------------------------
             Ambermoon 2D Map Viewer (Beta Version)
================================================================

================================================================
  COMPILING THE SOURCES
----------------------------------------------------------------
The current sources are in a messy state and were put together
in a hurry. They were only tested and compiled under Win32 with
lcc-win32, but should be portable to most systems supported by
the SDL library. Future revisions will be cleaned up, optimized
and (most important) commented.
The Win32 version uses the DLL editions of AMBlib and SDL. For
other systems, these must be linked statically.
To be honest, this version of the sources was just released
because Sourceforge requires it ;)
================================================================
  INSTALLING THE PROGRAM
----------------------------------------------------------------
AmberMap needs the original Ambermoon files in its subdirectory
"Amberfiles". The Win32 version also requires AMBlib.dll and
SDL.dll. The directory structure looks something like this:
  ./AmberMap.exe
  ./AMBlib.dll
  ./SDL.dll
  ./Extrafiles/Static_data.amb
  ./Amberfiles/*.amb
================================================================
  USING THE PROGRAM
----------------------------------------------------------------
This version is run from the command line with one parameter,
which is the number of the map to be loaded.
By default, map #257 (grandfather's house) is loaded.
If some map number gives a "failed to load" error, it either
doesn't exist or is a 3D map.
You'll have to play around to find out ;)
================================================================
  BUGS
----------------------------------------------------------------
There ARE bugs. On Windows, using Alt+Tab in Fullscreen mode is
not recommended, better switch to window mode and iconify the
window -- you have been warned!
================================================================
  FUTURE
----------------------------------------------------------------
Cleaning up the sources has highest priority. A map selection
menu would be nice. Moving the hardcoded stuff into an external
file should be more Copyright-compliant. Decipher the remaining
unknown bytes in IconData and find out how the events work.
Add the map texts (location name etc). Fix bugs, and blablabla.
